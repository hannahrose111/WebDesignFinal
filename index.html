        <p>He was a boy<br/>
She was a girl<br/>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br/>
He was a punk<br/>
She did ballet<br/>
What more can I say?<br/>
He wanted her<br/>
She'd never tell <br/>
Secretly she wanted him as well<br/>
But all of her friends<br/>
Stuck up their nose<br/>
They had a problem with his baggy clothes<br/>
He was a skater boy<br/>
She said, "see you later, boy"<br/>
He wasn't good enough for her<br/>
She had a pretty face<br/>
But her head was up in space<br/>
She needed to come back down to earth<br/>
Five years from now<br/>
She sits at home<br/>
Feeding the baby, she's all alone<br/>
She turns on TV<br/>
Guess who she sees<br/>
Skater boy rockin' up MTV<br/></p>
    </div>
<div id=lyrics2>
<p>
She calls up her friends<br/>
They already know<br/>
And they've all got tickets to see his show<br/>
She tags along<br/>
Stands in the crowd<br/>
Looks up at the man that she turned down<br/>
He was a skater boy<br/>
She said, "see you later, boy"<br/>
He wasn't good enough for her<br/>
Now he's a super star<br/>
Slammin' on his guitar<br/>
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br/>
He was a skater boy<br/>
She said, "see you later, boy"<br/>
He wasn't good enough for her<br/>
Now he's a super star<br/>
Slammin' on his guitar<br/>
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?</p>
</div> 
    
<div id=lyrics3>     
 <p>Sorry, girl, but you missed out<br/>
Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now<br/>
We are more than just good friends<br/>
This is how the story ends<br/>
Too bad that you couldn't see<br/>
See the man that boy could be<br/>
There is more that meets the eye<br/>
I see the soul that is inside<br/>
He's just a boy<br/>
And I'm just a girl<br/>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br/>
We are in love<br/>
Haven't you heard<br/>
How we rock each others world<br/>
I'm with the skater boy<br/>
I said, "see you later, boy"<br/>
I'll be back stage after the show<br/>
I'll be at the studio<br/>
Singing the song we wrote<br/>
About a girl you used to know<br/>
I'm with the skater boy<br/>
I said, "see you later, boy"<br/>
I'll be back stage after the show<br/>
I'll be at the studio<br/>
Singing the song we wrote<br/>
About a girl you used to know</p>
